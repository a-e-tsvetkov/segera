## Intentions

This project intent as learning exercise in Java network programming.
I want to create simple application and show how it can be done in incremental steps starting from working directly with sockets. End goal is NIO based library capable of working as zero memory footprint library.

### Versions

* V1 - Initial version
* V2 - Separate code into infrastructure and business layers.
* V3 - Extend protocol. Introduce multiple message types and protocol version.
* V4 - Switch server to NIO.
* V5 - Separate serialization logic and server logic.
* V6 - Model generator parser.
